# extensions_partial_automorphisms
This repository contains graphs, [graphs_with_non_extensible_partial_automorphisms.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16937200/graphs_with_non_extensible_partial_automorphisms.txt)
, that have partial automorphisms that are not extensible with algorithm provided in an article "Problem of extending partial automorphisms of a graph".

All graphs are stored as g6 strings.
